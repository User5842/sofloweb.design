I'm the type of person who always has an idea. I love to talk about and think about that idea--essentially, I obsess over it. Statistically, this is a bad thing because those ideas go nowhere.

Omni Lawns was different, though. I've gone somewhere.

In the last two weeks, I have learned more about software development, project management, running a business, and other related topics than I have in my day-to-day job.

I've spent some time practicing my craft daily and learning something new. Even if that meant I only spent 15 minutes on something, I still did it.

I've seen Tiago (the owner of Omni Lawns) at the gym a couple of times in the past weeks, and we've been able to discuss his website and overall business in person, which is one of the coolest parts of the job. I'm doing it, pursuing my business, going out there, and talking with clients.

If you're reading this and are in a familiar spot where you have an itch to do something, **JUST START**. I'm 31 years old now, and I have felt this way since around 24. It took nearly 7 years for something to stick, and it feels great. If you keep at it, it _will_ come.
