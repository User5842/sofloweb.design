I've been a software engineer for seven years, and during that time, I've had the opportunity to see projects go through design, implementation, and eventually release into customers' hands. The experience has been fulfilling, and I truly enjoy what I do. Work does not feel like work to me, and I am fortunate and blessed to be able to wake up every morning and give it my best.

Let's go on a slight tangent.

I have a large backyard, and despite my best efforts to mow it myself, I quickly realized that it wasn't for me. I started to search for someone to help me with my mowing needs, and I found someone who was great and was with me for a little over a year. The mowing quality was excellent as this was a single person, and they were easy to work with.

After that, I switched to another company, and the experience was not as great—quantity over quality. The grass was not cut to the standards I had grown to, and often, there would be a mess.

One day, as I was walking out of my home, I noticed a flyer for a company named **Omni Lawn**. I called them and eventually met with them in person. It turns out that "them" is also a single person (funny enough, he also went to the same gym I did—small world). The first cut was $20, so I gave him a shot, hoping it would align with the first mower I had a couple of years back (i.e., the quality would return).

I approached him and asked if he had a digital presence. I've always wanted to help local businesses create an online presence for customers to discover and engage with. He told me he did not have a website, and thus, **SoFlo Web Design** was born. We communicated back and forth for the next couple of days, and I worked on the website.

My dream was coming true. This interaction was the catalyst for this business I always wanted to start.

If you made it this far, thanks. I fully intend to deliver on the quality I hold to and help customers gain the conversion and traction they desire for their businesses. I look forward to documenting my journey here and seeing how far I can take this.
