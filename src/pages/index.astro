    <p>
      I was born and raised in Miami, FL. After doing software engineering for
      seven years and realizing I have a knack for social skills and
      interpersonal relationships, I wanted to improve my skills further.
    </p>
    <p>
      SoFlo Web Design came from my desire to help other businesses succeed in
      the digital world and provide them with the quality I deliver.
