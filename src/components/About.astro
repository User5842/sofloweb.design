      <p>
        I've been in the enterprise software engineering business for 7+ years.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        During that time, I have had the opportunity to take projects from
        design, implementation, and release into the hands of real customers.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        As I got older, I realized that some of me wanted to do more. I felt
        different from most of the other engineers that I worked with. I had
        high empathy and excellent communication skills, and so I wanted a way
        to funnel those skills into something productive, useful, and
        meaningful.

      <p class="mt-4">This is where the idea for SoFlo Web Design came from.</p>

        My hope with this agency is to provide local businesses with the
        opportunity to create an online presence and increase conversions. The
        web is not going anywhere anytime soon, and a simple yet effective
        presence can positively influence and engage your customers.
